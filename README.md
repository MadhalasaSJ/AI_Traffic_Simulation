Traffic Prediction using Bi-Directional LSTM

This project aims to predict traffic conditions, specifically traffic light signals and traffic volume, using a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. It processes time-series traffic data and trains a multi-task learning model that predicts both traffic light status and volume.

Project Overview

Traffic prediction plays a significant role in traffic management systems, enabling better control of traffic flow and reducing congestion. This project leverages a Bi-directional LSTM model to predict two targets:

Traffic Light Status - Classification task predicting the current status of the traffic light.
Traffic Volume - Regression task predicting the number of vehicles on the road.
The project is designed to handle time-series data and includes custom dataset handling, model training, and performance evaluation.
